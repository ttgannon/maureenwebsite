        Maureen Squires is a painter/calligrapher who approaches lettering from
        a painter's perspective and exhibits her work widely. She majored in
        painting at Seton Hill University and afterwards studied advanced
        calligraphy at Carnegie Melon with Arnold Banks and other fine
        calligraphers. She enjoys interpreting the words of others or simply
        experimenting with the abstract forms of the alphabet but also makes
        forays into landscape and abstract painting. Her tools range from
        traditional steel nibs to bamboo--"anything that writes"--using ink,
        acrylic, gouache, and Japanese watercolors
